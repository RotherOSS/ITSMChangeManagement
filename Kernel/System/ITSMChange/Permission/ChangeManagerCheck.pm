=head1 NAME

Kernel::System::ITSMChange::Permission::ChangeManagerCheck - change manager based permission check

=head1 PUBLIC INTERFACE

=head2 new()

Create an object.

    use Kernel::System::ObjectManager;
    local $Kernel::OM = Kernel::System::ObjectManager->new();
    my $CheckObject = $Kernel::OM->Get('Kernel::System::ITSMChange::Permission::ChangeManagerCheck');

    my ( $Type, %Param ) = @_;

    # allocate new hash for object
    my $Self = {};
    bless( $Self, $Type );

    return $Self;
}

=head2 Run()

This method does the check. C<ro> and C<rw> access is granted
when the agent has the privilege in the 'itsm-change-manager' group.

    my $HasAccess = $CheckObject->Run(
        UserID   => 123,
        Type     => 'rw',     # 'ro' or 'rw'
        ChangeID => 3333,     # optional for ChangeAdd
    );

=cut

sub Run {
    my ( $Self, %Param ) = @_;

    # check needed stuff
    for my $Argument (qw(UserID Type)) {
        if ( !$Param{$Argument} ) {
            $Kernel::OM->Get('Kernel::System::Log')->Log(
                Priority => 'error',
                Message  => "Need $Argument!",
            );

            return;
        }
    }

    # the check is based upon the change manager
    my $GroupID = $Kernel::OM->Get('Kernel::System::Group')->GroupLookup(
        Group => 'itsm-change-manager',
    );

    # deny access, when the group is not found
    return if !$GroupID;

    # get user groups, where the user has the appropriate privilege
    my %Groups = $Kernel::OM->Get('Kernel::System::Group')->GroupMemberList(
        UserID => $Param{UserID},
        Type   => $Param{Type},
        Result => 'HASH',
    );

    # allow ro and rw access if the agent is a change manager
    return 1 if $Groups{$GroupID};

    # no need to check whether the agent is the actual manager of the change

    # deny access otherwise
    return;
