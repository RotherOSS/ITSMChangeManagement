Kernel::System::ITSMChange::ITSMWorkOrder::Permission::CABCheck - CAB based permission check

=head1 PUBLIC INTERFACE

=head2 new()

Create an object.

    use Kernel::System::ObjectManager;

=head2 Run()

This method does the check. Access is allowed when type is C<ro> and the agent is a member
of the CAB of the change of the C<workorder>.

    );

    # deny access, when no workorder was found
